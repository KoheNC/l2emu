Yes. Please continue in your efforts. If you can get twenty bundles of brown moss, I will prepare them well for you. Jonas' dish will become even more astounding.<br>
As I explained before, in order to gather the Swamp Moss, you must go to the Cruma Marshes and hunt gray or crimson ants. Brown Swamp Moss is a very rare, so it will not be easy to find it.
