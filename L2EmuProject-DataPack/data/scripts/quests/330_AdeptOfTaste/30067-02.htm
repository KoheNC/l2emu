So you haven't been able to gather all the moss yet. As I told you, you must hunt giant ants like the<font color="LEVEL"> Gray Ant</font> and<font color="LEVEL"> Giant Crimson Ant</font> to obtain Swamp Moss. Bring me<font color="LEVEL"> twenty bundles of moss</font> and I will prepare them for cooking.<br>
Swamp Moss is usually green, but if you want a truly luxurious dish, you must invest the time and look for<font color="LEVEL"> brown moss</font>.
