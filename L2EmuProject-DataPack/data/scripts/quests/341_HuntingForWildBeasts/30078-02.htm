Excellent! I bet you'll give those filthy bears what they have coming. Kill <font color="LEVEL"> the Dion Grizzly</font>! Most of the bears by the river have already been killed, so you'll need to search nearby... Try the Dion Hills...<br>
In Gludio you will also find <font color="LEVEL"> Red Bears, Grizzly Bears, and Brown Bears</font>. I hate those filthy beasts! If I could I would obliterate every single stinking bear on earth!<br>
Bring me back<font color="LEVEL"> 20 bear pelts</font>. You'll be well-rewarded.
