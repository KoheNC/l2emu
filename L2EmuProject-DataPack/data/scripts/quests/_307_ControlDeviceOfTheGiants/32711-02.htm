The giants cave is very deep. In the bottom there is a monster named <font color="LEVEL">Hekaton Prime</font> who is hunting us. But don't be afraid, he is in the core of cave and can't escape.<br> 
However, beating him would mean alot to us. This region would become much more safer.<br>
My studies show that it is possible to beat him by using your willpower. So, do you agree to join me and help to make this place a safer one?<br>
