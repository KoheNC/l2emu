<font color=LEVEL>You'll find three different types of cursed pigs: <br>
Huge Cursed Pigs, Super Huge Cursed Pigs, and the rare Golden Cursed Pigs.<br><br>
 Purchase a Redemption Bow from Bonny and use the bow's "Forgiveness" and 
"Pardon" skills on the cursed pigs to free them from Zaken's Curse. When 
you cure a cursed pig, you'll get either Apiga or Pirate's Booty. 
Pirate's Booty are tiny treasure chests which may contain a valuable 
Golden Apiga.
