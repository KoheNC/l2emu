<html><title>Zaken's Curse Event</title><body>
You'll find four different types of cursed crew: <br>
* Giant Rats: These ordinary pirates were turned into mice that travel alone, but are able to stun you when you attack them. Fire a Pardon shot during the stun for the most effective results!<br><br>
* Super giant rats: The biggest, burliest of all the pirates, the Super giant rat is best taken on in a group.<br><br>
* Pink Giant Rats: These reclusive pirates were the masterminds behind the pilfering operation, so they carry the most Mouse Coins.<br><br>
Purchase a <font color=LEVEL>Redemption Bow</font> from Bonny and use the bow's "Forgiveness" and "Pardon" skills on the cursed crew to free them from Zaken's Curse. When you cure a member of the cursed crew, you'll get Mouse Coins. Bonny will award you prizes each time you turn in 20 Mouse Coins. Regular mobs also have a chance of dropping Mouse Coins. Collect as many Mouse Coins as you can!
