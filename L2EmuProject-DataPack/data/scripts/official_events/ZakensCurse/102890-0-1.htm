Bonny:<br><br>
I fear what kind of retaliation this will mean for my grandfather. 
His temper gets the best of him, and he's a bear to deal with sometimes, 
but he's still family. Besides, I think the thieves have learned their 
lesson. Don't you? I'll tell you what, if you help me undo this mess, 
I'll make it worth your while. I'll even put in a good word for you with 
grandpa! What do you say?<br><br>
