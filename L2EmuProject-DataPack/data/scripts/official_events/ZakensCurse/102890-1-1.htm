Bonny:<br><br>
I have a lot less compassion for the cursed crew than I did for the hapless thieves who stole from my grandfather last time, but I do have one concern. Who's going to man his ship? Not me, that's for sure! This is a problem. I think the crew have learned their lesson. Don't you? I'll tell you what, if you help me undo this mess, I'll make it worth your while. I'll even put in a good word for you with grandpa! What do you say<br><br>
