Bonny:<br><br>
Oh, now they've gone and done it! All the greedy people who have 
stolen from my grandfather's hideout through the years have finally 
pushed him over the edge. Just look at them! They've been turned into 
pigs! They should have known better, trying to steal from an all-powerful 
undead pirate captain and all, but I do feel a little sorry for them. 
Being stuck as a pig forever doesn't seem like a very happy fate 
(unless you enjoy mud baths).
