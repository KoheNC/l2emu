Yes! Good point! But now listen to important information.<br>
All Wintermelons absorb nectar, meow! <font color="LEVEL">When you double-click on your Wintermelon seeds, a Wintermelon will grow, but when you pour nectar onto it, it will grow EVEN FASTER!</font><br>
It it absorbs enough nectar, the Wintermelon will get bigger, until it can be broken into chunks when hit with a weapon!<br>
BUT, there are some things to remember!<br>
First, if you hit the Wintermelon before it fully grows, it will wither from malnutrition, so be careful, meow! Also, your Wintermelon will want to run away, so make sure you smash it before it is gone! Immature young Wintermelons run away after 3 minutes; and grown-up Wintermelons after 1 minute and 30 seconds!
Also, you can't smash Honey Wintermelons with ordinary weapons! You can only hit them with the Chrono weapons, meow! Also, it is very hard to smash Honey Wintermelons by yourself, so make sure you bring your friends to help you out! Lastly, when you smash the Wintermelon, you must do it on a flat land!
It would be a bad idea to smash them near a roof or cliff, meow! The hiliday would be ruined... AGAIN!<br>
Finally, there are genetically cloned seeds, or cloned honey Wintermelon seeds, meow. My master has planted them on monsters to experiment, but hasn't collected them yet! The cloned seeds have the same functions as the original ones, but can only be used by whoever collects them! Oh!<br>
