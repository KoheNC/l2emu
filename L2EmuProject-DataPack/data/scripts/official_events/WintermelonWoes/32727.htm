Puss the Cat:<br>
Meow! I am Puss the Cat! Puss the Cat in charge of winter celebration, and um... may have made a mistake this year! Meow! Easily done though!<br1>
Simple misunderstanding!<br>
You see, I had to take orders from Santa, just like every year. So, was speaking to him on crackly connection, and was taking a list of things to buy, when Santa said "and of course, we need the Wintermelons". Thought it was strange, but ordered like a good cat. Next day, Santa screams at Puss, sayling he said "and of course, we need the bells on"! Santa can't fly without bells on sled, so can't come to Aden this year! Terrible, terrible mistake! Terrible Puss!<br1>
Meow!<br>
So this year, no Santa, and thousands of Wintermelons! What's a cat to do... but start a <font color="LEVEL">WINTERMELON EVENT!</font> Who needs Santa and presents when there are Wintermelons to be grown?!<br>
These beauties just need nectar to grow, and maybe we'll be able to give out priz... PRESENTS... to the people who can raise strong and sturdy Wintermelons! Me-ow!<br>
