Meow! Nice to meet you! I'm Roy the Cat!<br>
By the request of the great collector Bechtel of the Bronze Key Guild, I'm collecting medals that are scattered around the world. So I'm here at this village as collector Bechtel's representative. Meow!<br>
We can't collect all those medals on our own, so we've been getting help through our event! It's called <font color="LEVEL">Find it? Collect it! Medal collecting event!</font> We take the medals that people collect and trade them for premiums, meow! So if you have medals, hurry hurry hurry and bring them in!<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 0">Trade medals for event premiums.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 1">Listen to an explanation about the event.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 2">See event premiums</a><br>
