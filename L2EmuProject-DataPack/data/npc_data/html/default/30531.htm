<html><body>First Elder Lockirin:<br>
Welcome, young friend, to the House of Elders. My name is Lockirin Stonecutter. I am the eldest Master of the <font color="LEVEL">Iron Gate Guild</font> and also the First Elder of the <font color="LEVEL">Association of Guild Elders</font>. These titles sound fine enough, but really my job is to keep these headstrong old chaps in line.<br>
