<html><body>Officer Tepios:<br>
Welcome to the Seed of Infinity. My name is Officer Tepios. My role is to build temporary shelters and guide newcomers around here.<br>
This is the place we call the <font color="LEVEL">Death Gate</font>. Many soldiers and unnamed adventurers have gone to their deaths through this entrance.<br>
However, we must continue to venture through it to face our enemies. It is our fate, I suppose. If you would help us, we will reward you on behalf of Admiral Keucereus.<br>
