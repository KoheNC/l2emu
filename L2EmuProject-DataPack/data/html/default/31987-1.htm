Guard Gotter:<br>
The Plunderous Plains are as dreary as they sound! An old railroad crosses them, and goes all the way to Schuttgart Castle. There's a Strip Mine in the east that was abandoned by the Dwarves, and an old harbor in the south. When traveling there you must beware of the gangs of bandits and Kobolds. I must get back to work now. Goodbye.<br>
