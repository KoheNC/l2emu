<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
(The statue is worn in places by wind and rain -- proof that is has stood guard here a long, long time. Despite its weatherbeaten appearance, it feels somehow dignified and majsetic. Standing before it, you sense a presence. )<br>
You, oustide... Why have you come here to this statue?<br>
For I am Mother Shilen's avatar and the last guard of Sailren!<br>
