Readme:
<br><br>
Free Lineage II Server files, based on Java. Our mother fork is l2j-free and l2j/l2jdp.<br>
<br>
L2Emu only supports L2Emu software obtained directly from L2Emu sources.<br>
<br>
WARNING: L2EmuProject is NOT a plug and play software. You can find this part of README in all L2 packs.<br>
What does it mean? If you want a server just to play the game, go to the official server.<br>
If you want L2Emu or any L2 server you have to spend a lot of time on working with it. L2Emu is NOT exception from it.<br>
If you are living in a dream about L2 packs, and you think everything is works and perfect. Wake up, stop it NOW.<br>
<br>
