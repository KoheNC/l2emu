Hail! Nice to meet you, traveler. I am the one who can help you to increase your abilities and give powerfull protection for your soul and spirit.
<br>
But nothing's free in this world and for all my services you must pay. And keep in mind, I won't teach a young and unexperienced one, for my services your level must be atleast <font color="LEVEL">40</font>.
<br>
How can I help you? If you buy my Deluxe Buffs you will get not only&#160;<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 1"><font color="LEVEL">common support magic</font></a>&#160;
but additional for&#160;<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 2"><font color="LEVEL">fighters</font></a>&#160;and&#160;<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 3"><font color="LEVEL">mages</font></a>.
<br>
If you're more interested in protection, then I have some&#160;<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 4"><font color="LEVEL">resistance</font></a>&#160;magic for you.
<br>
So, have you made your choice?
