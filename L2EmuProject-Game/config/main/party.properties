# then party bonus acquired for him (30% for 2 member party)
# In that case he will not receive any Exp/SP from party and is not counted for party bonus
# The second option takes effect when "percentage" method is chosen. Don't use high values for this!
# The third option takes effect when "level" method is chosen. Don't use low values for this!

# then just set the first option to "none". Defaults are: percentage, 3.0, 30; respectively.
